# Certificate.Monitoring

*Certificate.Monitoring.xml* discovers and monitors certs in local machine *Personal* store using **PowerShell**.

*YourCompany.PKI.xml* is quite old and it discovers and monitors CAs and certificates using **VBScript**. It's meant for an internal PKI where you have access to all servers. You will need search/replace 
*YourCompany* string and make other mods as needed.
